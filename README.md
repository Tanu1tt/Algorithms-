# Algorithms-
This repo consist basic information &amp; implementation of algorithms which we used in day to day life for solving technical issues/ bugs.  

The idea is to maintain a maximum (positive-sum) subarray “ending” at each index of the given array. This subarray is either empty (in which case its sum is zero) or consists of one more element than the maximum subarray ending at the previous index.
